# About CLOG

CLOG, or The Common Lisp Omnificent GUI, is a dynamic web-based framework that empowers developers to build graphical user interfaces entirely in Common Lisp, bypassing traditional frontend languages. By harnessing WebSockets for seamless real-time communication between a Lisp server and the browser, CLOG renders GUIs client-side while executing all core logic server-side. This innovative approach delivers responsive desktop, mobile, and web applications with minimal overhead, supporting cross-platform deployment on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, and Raspberry Pi. Compatible with Lisp implementations like SBCL, CCL, and ECL, it has powered production systems since 2013, offering a stable API that's both powerful and intuitive for rapid prototyping.
